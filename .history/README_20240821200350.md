# NodeExpress Promptset(for FastBuilder.AI)

## Promptset Node.js Express.js MVCC Application Generator

Welcome to the Node.js Express.js MVCC Application Generator repository! This repository contains a collection of prompts and templates for generating full-stack applications using Node.js, Express.js, and the MVCC (Model-View-Controller-Component) architecture. Leveraging generative software engineering principles, these prompts are designed to automate and streamline the development process, enabling you to quickly generate robust and scalable applications.

### Features

- **Automated Code Generation**: Easily generate custom boilerplate code for Node.js and Express.js applications with a focus on the MVCC architecture suited for your specific needs.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Implement a scalable MVCC structure that separates concerns between models, views, controllers, and components.
- **Customizable Templates**: Tailor the generated code to fit your specific project requirements by modifying the included  prompts and product story using FastBuilder.
- **Best Practices**: Follow industry best practices for organizing and structuring Node.js applications, ensuring maintainability and scalability.
- **Integration-Ready**: Simplified integration with various databases, front-end frameworks, and third-party services.

### Benefits

- **Security**: Eliminate coding flaws from erroneous use of non-standard coding practices and unnecessary overloading. Reduce the chances of zero day attacks and other cyber security risks due to code flaw vectors.
- **Efficiency**: Save numerous mandays in planning the architecture, baseline coding and lifecycle of change management.
- **Zero Tech Debt**: Never have an open enhancement or bug fix due to lack of budget. Just update the story or prompt or the AI to get the best version of the system everytime.


### Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FastBuilderAI/nodejs-express-mvcc-generator-promptset.git
   cd nodejs-express-mvcc-generator
   ```

2. **Setup Product Story and Promptset**:
   Login to FastBuilder.AI and create a free account. Build the product story and add the promptset.
   

3. **Get the code generation estimate, fund your account and run the code generation**:
   Click on "Test Generation". Get the cost estimate for code generation and fund the account for maximum limit.
   

4. **Customize Your Application**:
   Modify the generated code according to your project's needs. Link the project repository and sync to your story board. All further story changes will update your code.
